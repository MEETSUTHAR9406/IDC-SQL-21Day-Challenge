# IDC-SQL-21Day-Challenge

## Welcome to my IDC SQL 21-Day Challenge repository!

### This repo documents my journey of learning SQL step by step over 21 days, building consistency, practical skills, and a growth mindset. Each day includes SQL exercises and practice scripts performed using MySQL Workbench and PgAdmin 4.

### Objectives:
Learn SQL fundamentals and advanced queries <br>
Practice creating, modifying, and querying databases <br>
Build consistency through daily coding <br>
Track progress publicly for self-motivation and accountability <br>
