# 🩺 Day 02 – Filtering Data with WHERE Clause

## 📘 Topics Covered
- Filtering data using the **WHERE** clause  
- Using **comparison operators** (=, >, <, >=, <=, !=)  
- Combining conditions with **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT**  
- Pattern matching with **LIKE** and **IN**  
- Using **BETWEEN** for range filtering  

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- **WHERE** filters records based on conditions  
- **Comparison operators** compare values in columns  
- **Logical operators** combine multiple conditions  
- **Strings use single quotes (‘ ’)**  
- Use **IS NULL** or **IS NOT NULL** to check for missing values

## 💻 Basic Syntax Examples

```sql
-- Select patients older than 60
SELECT * 
FROM patients
WHERE age > 60;

-- Retrieve patients from 'Emergency' service
SELECT * 
FROM patients
WHERE service = 'Emergency';

-- Multiple conditions using AND
SELECT * 
FROM patients
WHERE age > 60 AND service = 'Cardiology';

-- Using IN for cleaner filtering
SELECT * 
FROM patients
WHERE service IN ('Emergency', 'Cardiology', 'Surgery');

-- Using BETWEEN for range
SELECT * 
FROM patients
WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 65;
